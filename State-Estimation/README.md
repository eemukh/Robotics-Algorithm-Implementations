KF_implementation.m : File for implementation of a robot drawing to move with a constant velocity input 
                      over a 10 second runtime, starting from the origin. This file uses an implementation 
                      of the Kalman Filter Algorithm for state estimation.

KF_GoalPos.m        : File for implementation of a robot drawing to move to a set goal position, starting 
                      from the origin while using a Kalman Filter for state estimation.
